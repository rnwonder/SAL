- We can use a pivot table to store the relationship between the merchant and the product. The pivot table will have the merchant ID and the product ID as foreign keys.

- Or we can add the merchant ID as a foreign key in the product table. This will allow us to easily retrieve all the products associated with a particular merchant. Reducing the need for joins. Also, simplifying the query. And we can easily index the merchant ID to improve the performance of the query.

<summary>How can you design the database for this particular problem for performance given that you have a large number of merchants?</summary>

- Indexing
  - Indexing is a way to optimize the performance of a database by minimizing the number of disk accesses required when a query is processed. It is a data structure technique which is used to quickly locate and access the data in a database. Indexes are used to quickly locate data without having to search every row in a database table every time a database table is accessed.
- Caching
  - Caching is a technique used to store the result of an expensive operation and then reusing it when the same operation is performed again. It is used to improve the performance of the application. Caching is used to store the result of an expensive operation and then reusing it when the same operation is performed again. It is used to improve the performance of the application.
- Optimized Queries
  - Optimized queries are used to improve the performance of the application. It is used to reduce the number of database calls and improve the performance of the application. Optimized queries are used to reduce the number of database calls and retrieves only the necessary data and use efficient join operations.

<summary>What would inform your choice of a database when solving this particular problem?</summary>

- Scalability
  - The database should be able to handle a large number of merchants and products.
- Performance
  - Choose a database that can efficiently store and retrieve data, especially for complex queries involving joins.
- Reliability
  - The database should be reliable and provide data consistency and integrity.
